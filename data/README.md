Information on download time and location available in the README inside each individual folder

## Folders

- **blast_db**: BLAST databases from all NCBI _Alveolata_ nucleotide sequences and all _Arthropoda_ nucleotide sequences. Sequences downloaded from [NCBI taxonomy browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cg) as FASTA files. _Alveolata_ sequences downloaded 2021-02-17, _Arthropoda_ sequences downloaded 2021-02-24

- **indiv_libraries**: Trimmed individual libraries of infected crab. Downloaded from Gannet, available [here](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200318_cbai_RNAseq_fastp_trimming/). Due to large file sizes, libraries were deleted from local machine after kallisto indices were created

- **ncbi_genomes**: Genomes of related species downloaded from NCBI database. Sequences downloaded from [NCBI taxonomy browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cg) as FASTA files. [Link to _Chionoecetes opilio_ protein sequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid41210%5BOrganism:exp%5D), and [link to _Amoebophrya sp. genome sequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid1775427%5BOrganism:exp%5D). Genomes downloaded on 2021-03-02

- **pooled_libraries**: Trimmed pooled libraries of infected crab. Downloaded from Gannet, some from [here](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200414_cbai_RNAseq_fastp_trimming/)

- **transcriptomes**:
